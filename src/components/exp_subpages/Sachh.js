            <div className="grid-item">
              <p>The Sachh Foundation wanted to completely rebuild their site. As the foundation grows, it was important to create a website that had all the neccesary information about their mission and achievements. Another importance was the ability to reach a large audience.</p>

            </div>
            <div className="grid-item">
              <p>Before prototyping the site's redesign, I needed to research and get an idea of how other non-profits organized their website to sucessfully convey their mission. The foundation was moving forward from a blog-styled site to formal informative site, so I needed to map out some ideas for the site's design.</p>
              <p>After the initial research phase, I created a document to present to the team how I plan to go about designing the website. To summarize the document, I discussed the site's potential colors, fonts, and layout for each page.</p>

              <p>This was a collaborative project. I worked in a team of three other interns, where we regularly communicated with the founder about the progress and any neccesary changes needed to be made. It was collectively decided that the site's layout will be based on the plan I presented to the group - while adjustments were made to the final product, the central theme was as I outlined.</p>
              These were the pages I created:
              <ul>
                <li>Homepage</li>
                <li>Who We Are Subpages - The Youth and Our Founder </li>
                <li>News & Media</li>
                <li>Get Involved</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition, I was in charge of ensuring the site was mobile friendly and that each page was cohesive with the rest of the site.</p>
